# What is this?

## Description: 
I use to love the website "StumbleUpon" for it's ability to randomly send you to somewhere interesting. This project is meant to be my own version of "StumbleUpon". I want to create a very clean and simple website, a title, and a buch of clickable dots. Each dot is a link to a random place. Users will have the ability to create a dot and fill it with what ever link they want to.

### MVP:
- Full CRUD on creating and deleting dots
- Website Frame (styled and built)
- Random placement and color of dots everytime the site reloads (or maybe on a timer??)
- See a profile page with your dots on it and descriptions of what they are. 

### Stretch:
- Filter dots based on content
- Saftey Parts (make sure website has no virus or won't break a computer)

## Wire Frame:
